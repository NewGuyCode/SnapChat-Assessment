# SnapChat-Assessment (The good, the bad, the ugly) 

Day 1 ðŸ˜€: (Feeling Excited & Optimistic)

-Was at work for the day so no actual coding was done
-spent time just doing html/css refreshers 
-jot down some of the things I "planned" to implement

Day 2 ðŸ˜…: (Started off strong but getting stuck on an easy part lead to a bit of Imposter Syndrome) 

-Watched and coded along a couple of throwaway project on Youtube
-Memory was slowly coming back
-Did basic Html structure layout for my website
*SPENT 3 HOURS on setting up my styles.css 
  -contemplated my sanity
  -physically stressing me more then the actual CSS itself 
  -had to call it a day, couldn't resolve 
  
Day 3 ðŸ˜°: (Resolved the CSS sheet, felt dumb so Imposter Syndrome was lurking) 
 
- After googling and looking up similiar issues on stackoverflow I realised my screw up
- css.styles was NOT LOCATED IN THE SAME FOLDER. OMFG path was not relative. 
- spent most of the time fumbling through CSS, experminenting and googling issues that popped up along the way
- today I felt a lot more humble, and my CSS knowledge was expanding.
- got stuck styling my pictures, I picked some CRAZY HUGE PICTURES but they were gorgoues so I stood my ground and fiddle with sizing them
  -2 hours later I failed to styled them and called it quits.
  
Day 4 ðŸ˜­: (Imposter Sydrome at nearing it's peak. Why did I put off learning Git for so long OMG)

- Kept googling to fix my errors
- wrote ALOT of spaghetti code that had very bad structure
- while working with CSS I realize the importance of good structure and class names
- being able to use CSS selectors properly and style the appropriate element was important
- coded through the day, watched some mobile first tutorial on YouTube. 
- Realized I should've did mobile first design instead of the reverse, running low on time might not implement media queries into website

Day 5 ðŸ’€: (I am an Imposter, project is still not how I want it to be, but I must submit something)

- Good news learned how to use GIT and GITHUB 
- Bad news problems from day 3 and 4 weren't fully resolved
- Banner was still too large
- Picture of menu items were no bueno
- Realize the importance of setting up containers, but my brain is too fried to put in anymore info
- Been coding day and night since Day 3 and feeling a little dissapointed at the end result
- However this is my first time deploying and setting up a website. I felt like I learned more in 5 days then I did spending a couple of weeks on Udemy tutorial
- PRACTICE IS KEY OMG. I'm doing more projects after this to get better. No more code along tutorials to hold my hand.
